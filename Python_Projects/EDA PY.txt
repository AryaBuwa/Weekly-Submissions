# Titanic EDA Project

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival rates based on different factors such as age, gender, class, and family size.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`).

## Steps in Analysis
1. **Load and Inspect Data**  
   - Read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Display the first few rows and dataset shape.
   
2. **Handle Missing Values**  
   - Identify and count missing values.
   - Handle missing data appropriately.

3. **Data Exploration**  
   - Display passenger information (e.g., age, gender, class, survival status).
   - Filter data based on conditions (e.g., first-class passengers, male/female distribution).
   - Compute statistics such as average fare and survival rates.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create a `family_size` column by summing `sibsp` and `parch`.
   - Analyze survival rates for passengers who traveled alone (`family_size = 0`).
   - Compute the probability of survival for passengers aged between 20 and 30.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the following Python libraries:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Running the Notebook
Use the following command to launch Jupyter Notebook and open the analysis:
```sh
jupyter notebook EDA_PY.ipynb
```

## Results
- Key insights from the dataset analysis are documented within the notebook.
- Survival trends based on different factors are visualized and interpreted.

## Credits
- This project is performed using **Jupyter Notebook**.
- The dataset was sourced from the **internet(kaggle)**.
