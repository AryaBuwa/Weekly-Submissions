# Career Recommender

## Overview

This project helps in recommending the most suitable career based on the skills inputted by the user. It uses a machine learning model to compare the skills entered with those required for various careers and outputs the best matching career.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn (for machine learning and cosine similarity)
- pandas (for managing career data)
- numpy (for array handling)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the script:
