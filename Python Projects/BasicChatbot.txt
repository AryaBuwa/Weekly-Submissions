Purpose: The program demonstrates a basic chatbot implementation using Python.

Response Dictionary: A dictionary stores predefined questions and responses for the chatbot.

Continuous Interaction: A while loop ensures the chatbot runs continuously until the user types "exit."

Input Normalization: User inputs are cleaned using .strip().lower() to handle extra spaces and case mismatches.

Valid Input Check: The chatbot checks if the user input matches a key in the dictionary and responds accordingly.

Invalid Input Handling: If the input is invalid or empty, the chatbot provides helpful prompts to guide the user.

Predefined Responses: The chatbot includes responses to common questions, such as greetings, inquiries about Python, and fun facts.

Exit Option: Typing "exit" gracefully ends the interaction with a goodbye message.

Learning Project: This program serves as a hands-on learning exercise for Python programming.

Acknowledgment: Special thanks to OpenAI's ChatGPT for guiding the development and refinement of the chatbot.

# Chatbot Code:

response = {
    'hello': "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
    'how are you': 'I am good! How are you?',
    'how can you help me': "I can answer a set of questions on which I am programmed.",
    'what is your purpose': 'My purpose is to assist and interact with you in meaningful ways.',
    'are you a human': 'No, I am a virtual assistant created with programming and logic.',
    'what is python': 'Python is a popular programming language used for building many things, including me!',
    'can you tell me a fun fact': 'Sure! Did you know octopuses have three hearts?',
    'what languages you speak': 'I understand English and can work with other languages if programmed to do so.',
    'do you know riddles': 'Yes! What has to be broken before you can use it? (Answer: An egg!)',
    'can you recommend a movie': "Sure! How about watching The Matrix - it's a classic!",
    'why are you here': 'I am here to make your life easier and more fun.',
    'what are you': 'I am just a responsive chatbot developed with the help of Python dictionaries.',
    'okay': 'Thank You!',
    'exit': 'Goodbye! Have a nice day!'
}

while True:
    chatbot_input = input("Hello, How Can I Help You? ").strip().lower()
    
    if chatbot_input == 'exit':
        print(response['exit'])
        break
    elif chatbot_input in response:
        print(response[chatbot_input])
    elif chatbot_input == '':
        print("You haven't typed anything yet. Please ask a question.")
    else:
        print("Please enter a valid response.")
