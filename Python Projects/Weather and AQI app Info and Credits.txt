It delivers key weather metrics, including temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.
The code also retrieves AQI data to assess the air quality condition.
The output of code is enhanced with vibrant colors using the colorama library to improve readability.
It incorporates error handling for incorrect city names and manages any missing data in the AQI response.
