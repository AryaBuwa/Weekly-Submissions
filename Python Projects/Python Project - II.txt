To-Do List Application
This Python project implements a simple command-line To-Do List application that allows users to:

Add tasks: Input task descriptions which are saved in a list.
Remove tasks: Remove tasks by selecting their index.
Mark tasks as completed: Update task status to "Completed".
View tasks: Display the list of tasks with their current status.
Exit: Exit the program.
The application uses a TodoList class for task management and handles invalid inputs with error messages.

Key Improvements:
Tasks are managed within the TodoList class.
Added input validation and error handling.
Clearer user prompts for a better experience.
