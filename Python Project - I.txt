This Python Project implements a simple command-line phonebook application. It allows users to:

Add new contacts: Users can input a contact's name and phone number, which are stored in a dictionary.
View all contacts: The application displays all saved contacts with their corresponding phone numbers.
Exit the application: Users can choose to exit the program.
The script uses functions to organize the code and improve readability. 
Error handling is included to manage invalid user input. 
This project demonstrates basic dictionary usage, input/output operations, and control flow in Python. 

Key improvements in this version:
Contacts dictionary initialization: The Contacts dictionary is now initialized outside the functions. 
This is crucial; otherwise, the dictionary would be reset every time new_contact() is called.
Docstrings: Added docstrings to functions to explain their purpose, which is best practice for code documentation.
Clearer error message in view_contacts(): The message is now "No contacts found!" instead of a confusing message involving a potentially undefined name.
More descriptive phonebook() docstring: The docstring now clearly explains the application's functionality.
Comments refined: The comments are now more concise and focus on explaining the why rather than the what (which should be clear from the code itself).
